# Metro OnTime Project

A data analysis/visualization project incubated at Hack for LA. Our mission is to highlight LA Metro's performance and data transparency to improve ridership.

## Goals
 - Log vehicle trip and position data from Metro's real-time API in order to build up a historical record of trip data 
 - Estimate arrival times at rail/subway stations for each trip logged
 - Compare scheduled timetables to actual arrival times calculated from our model, and derive a statistical analysis of Metro's performance
 - Refine the process and develop an automated "health check" to be performed daily/weekly/monthly/annually

## Non-Goals
 - Attempt to provide/improve-upon real-time arrival predictions or notifications. This has already been largely addressed by Transit App's partnership with Swiftly - integrating the LA Metro real-time data feed with crowd-sourced mobile app data to improve prediction accuracy and data reliability. 
 - Initially at least, the primary focus is on Metro Rail data only - not the bus network
