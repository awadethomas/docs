**Why**: Current Metro (train and busses) system take up to 3 minutes to update the metro\'92s (train & bus) current location

## Transit App w/GO
**What**: An Metro product that aims to predict train positions based on trainriders using the Go service
- When the service is being used, more accurate arrival times can be predicted
**Problem**: Transit w/Go relies on users to be logged into their system on riding to keep the bus/train data up to date for everyone // Difficult to use the app & not as accurate as it used to be
**Benefits**: Can be used internationally? // Also tracks bus locations // Live display of people you are helping (do good) // if you stop using the app live display of people you are no longer helping (guilt)

## Google Maps
**What**: All in one metro and transit app that predicts arrivals and has real time views of where metro trains and busses are // Also real-time delays (adjustments) to train/bus schedules will notify android users
**Problem**: Users have to be using GoogleMaps for their commute // They must have an android app for notifications
**Benefits**: All in one tool that can be used internationally // Music integration, etc
