# Metro Ontime Key Notes
### Next Steps
Need to create a UX Backlog
- Develop User Persona for X
	- User Interviews
		- Metro LA Staff
		- Policy Makers
		- General Public (who ride metro, have a smartphone, interested in timing)
	- General User Research
		- What are the user needs?
	- Create User Flows
		- How will the project be used?
		- What is the journey of using the tool? - (before, after, etc…)
	- Draft Stakeholder Questions
		- Hold a Metro LA interview
		- Draw from interview  on what opportunities exist
	- Create a Project Plan
		- Create a Calendar (Include all of our meetings / travel dates / times people will be unavailable)
		- Determine realistically what we need (resources) to deliver 
	- Create Wireframes

Understand who the users are as a whole
- Who could they possibly be
- Then target who they can be
Go through the MetroLA Research that has been done so far
- Look at GoogleDocs
Ask Alex what questions he has asked so far and what the perception was
Come up with a list of questions to ask the Metro Contacts
- Understand questions asked by the team so far

Who should the user be…?
- Understand the various user types
	- Policy Makers
	- Metro Company Themselves
	- Analysts 
	- General Public…?
